## About this app

To have a speedy start [simple-react-full-stack](https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack) was used. This is a boilerplate tp build a full stack web application using React, Node.js, Express and Webpack.

The app shows a list of popular movies using [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). The user can search for movies by title and is shown more details, when clicking on a movie.
